// The UWP XAML front end: the app menu (games, installs, settings), progress and error screens and
// the in-game pause menu, built from the XAML pages in uwp/app/xaml/ with Windows.UI.Xaml.
//
// There is no XAML compiler on the Linux build host, so the pages are parsed at run time with
// XamlReader and wired up through hand-written WinRT ABI calls (winrt_xaml_abi.h is generated from
// the SDK metadata). The game picture is shown through a SwapChainPanel that the render thread of
// the shell presents into.
